Ideas...
  Can see / interact with x turns in the future
  Finite number of turns until the match ends?
    Maybe the match ends when the player loses and the players actions push that deadline out until they reach victory?
      Maybe that victory can still be altered by anomolies occuring?
  Need to force the player to balance certain decisions during their turns
    Can't just win-win-win, needs to be something fighting against the player or multiple balls being juggled
  Deck builder?
    Needs to play cards to make things happen, also need to expand / alter deck to win
    Cards are actions AND currency?
    Need some sort of automated threat system
s the engine what to do when the card is played

rift in space time stabilizing
trying to keep rift from becoming stable,

each turn add that turn's worth of stability to the rift if unmitigate
rift open at ___ stability, player start losing at turn 10? (50 default? can change for difficulty)
stability to the rift can get out of hand if the player doesn't act quickly enough

monsters (hp/atk) - 3 factions (hopefully)
  Rift Denizens
  rift spawn = 2/1 creature, if 3 on board together combine to a:
    rift beast = inputs added * 2 (up to 12/6)
  rift lord = 5/5 create

  The King in Yellow (FOCUS HERE FIRST!!!!)
  faceless one = 3/3
  timeless horror = 4/2
  the unspeakable one = 6/6

  Dimensional Walkers
  the lost = 3/1 - threat to player hp, lots of them in the deck, easy to have to overcommit to kill due to low hp
  wanderer = 2/6 - may take multiple turns to kill
  the traveler = 2/15


Victory conditions?
  defeat boss of encounter without rift stabilizing (depends on size of encounter deck, maybe some cards can speed this up? draw more or the encounter deck at risk of needing to deal with it)

Loss Conditions?
  Player is overrun (too many active encounter cards unresolved)
