Ideas...
  Can see / interact with x turns in the future
  Finite number of turns until the match ends?
    Maybe the match ends when the player loses and the players actions push that deadline out until they reach victory?
      Maybe that victory can still be altered by anomolies occuring?
  Need to force the player to balance certain decisions during their turns
    Can't just win-win-win, needs to be something fighting against the player or multiple balls being juggled
  Deck builder?
    Needs to play cards to make things happen, also need to expand / alter deck to win
    Cards are actions AND currency?
    Need some sort of automated threat system


Game Objects to Make
- Deck
- Card
- Turn Tracker

Cards in Hand need to be pick-up-able
Cands in Store need to be clickable
Deck shows number of cards in deck
deck => hand => discard => deck
player health and some secondary health/pool/resource
lose if either hits 0
some cards are player oriented, some objective oriented, some both?
some growing / constant threat against the secondary pool
each turn an encounter deck / source add a random additional threat to the player to be dealt with
some cards that stay in play once played? (can no longer spend them, but constant benefit going forward)

cards have: cost, value, type, effects

card meta data in json format?
  name: name of the card
  cost: how much currency it takes to obtain a copy of the card
  value: how much the card adds to this turn's currency pool if spent instead of played
  type: action, constant, ?? (also determines border color)
  art: name of sprite to render as the card art
  effects: some sort of tokens or script that tells the engine what to do when the card is played

some sort of simple scripting language to safely define card effects?
  maybe just tokenized function calls and parameters (ie drawCards 2, addCurrency 5, addDefense 5, etc..)

encounter deck only "attacks" the player?

rift in space time stabilizing
trying to keep rift from becoming stable,

each turn add that turn's worth of stability to the rift if unmitigate
rift open at ___ stability, player start losing at turn 10? (50 default? can change for difficulty)
stability to the rift can get out of hand if the player doesn't act quickly enough

what spawns from the encounter deck?
things to defeat? (certain hp & cause damage each turn they are alive?)

monsters (hp/atk) - 3 factions (hopefully)
  Rift Denizens
  rift spawn = 2/1 creature, if 3 on board together combine to a:
    rift beast = inputs added * 2 (up to 12/6)
  rift lord = 5/5 create

  The King in Yellow (FOCUS HERE FIRST!!!!)
  faceless one = 3/3
  timeless horror = 4/2
  the unspeakable one = 6/6

  Dimensional Walkers
  the lost = 3/1 - threat to player hp, lots of them in the deck, easy to have to overcommit to kill due to low hp
  wanderer = 2/6 - may take multiple turns to kill
  the traveler = 2/15

anomolies - events rather than enemies, maybe some effect player and others the rift
  gravity wave ?

Victory conditions?
  defeat boss of encounter without rift stabilizing (depends on size of encounter deck, maybe some cards can speed this up? draw more or the encounter deck at risk of needing to deal with it)
  seal the rift (still need a mechanics for this, point system? seals? stitches?)

Loss Conditions?
  Rift stabilized
  Player HP <= 0
  Player is overrun (too many active encounter cards unresolved)
